# Master_Thesis: Annotation artistic images with deep learning
## Under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Geurts and Matthi Sabatelli, ULi√®ge 2019
### Objectives:
The objectives of this project is to automatically find bounding boxes of musical instruments and classify them in artistic images. To do so, we used a dataset of artistic instruments from cytomine and used transfer learning from imagenet and MIMO (Musical Instrument Museum Online). Furthermore, we styled transfer image from MIMO in order to make data augmentation. In more of this, this project aimed to show which parts of the images the model is focused on in order to make prediction. This could help the experts of this field to have intuition of what these networks do (instead of black boxes).
