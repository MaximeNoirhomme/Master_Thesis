# Master_Thesis: Annotation artistic images with deep learning
## Under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Geurts and Matthia Sabatelli, ULi√®ge 2019
### Objectives:
The objectives of this project is to automatically find bounding boxes of musical instruments and classify them in artistic images. To do so, we used a dataset of artistic instruments from cytomine and used transfer learning from imagenet and MIMO (Musical Instrument Museum Online). Furthermore, we styled transfer image from MIMO in order to make data augmentation. We used "classical" transfer learning and domain adversial method. In more of this, this project aimed to show which parts of the images the model is focused on in order to make prediction. This could help the experts of this field to have intuition of what these networks do (instead of black boxes).
### How to use ?
First, you have to specified which task you want to perform, train a model using classical transfer learning (1), using domain adversial (2), show results like confusion matrix (3), visualizing networks (4) or handling dataset (5) ?
To specified it, do:
          python main.py name_task
where name_task is either:
  - classic (1)
  - dan (2)#TODO: make it accesible from main.py
  - plot (3)
  - visu (4)
  - dataHandling (5)
### classic
In order to train a model using "classic" method, you have to specify which dataset(s) you want to use in the training and some hyper parameter(s) (if not set, default ones are used). Concerning the dataset, you can either directly mentionned the list of csv files that contains the information about the splitting train/valid/test using --csv_train_path (for example: --csv_train_path 0-s7 1-s7) or give enough information to infer it. These information are the name(s) of the dataset (the name(s) could be found at convention_names/dataset_mapping.csv and specified with --trainset), the mode which is 0 (meaning that the dataset has been splitted into 70/10/20 for training, validation and testing) or 1 (the dataset is not splitted) and specified with --mode, the seed with --seed and when it is a style transfer dataset, the --prop argument indicate the proportion of the mimo dataset that has been used for the style transfer. 
### dan
TODO: since it is not accessible from main.py for now
### plot
### dataHandling
